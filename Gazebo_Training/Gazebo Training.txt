Gazebo Training

1. I followed the videos from The Construct to create an Arm Robot. I used the online ROS Develeopment Studio developed by the Construct and created the simulation on ROS Kinetic (the distro used)



2. I followed Moore Robots Tutorial to make a 2 wheeled (then tried to make it into a 4 wheeled) bot with a camera.
